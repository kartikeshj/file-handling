        " Multithreading\n",
        "Multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process. These threads share the same memory space, which makes communication between them fast and easy. However, in Python, multithreading is limited by something called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This lock allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which means multithreading doesn’t offer true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks. It’s best used for I/O-bound operations—like reading files, making network requests, or waiting for user input—where the program spends time waiting and can benefit from overlapping tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        " Multiprocessing\n",
        "Multiprocessing, on the other hand, uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space. This means they don’t share data directly, but they can run truly in parallel on multiple CPU cores. This makes multiprocessing ideal for CPU-bound tasks—like complex calculations, data analysis, or image processing—where you want to fully utilize your machine’s processing power. Since each process is isolated, it also provides better fault tolerance: if one crashes, it doesn’t take down the others.\n",
